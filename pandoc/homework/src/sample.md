#

_Count the rectangles of all sizes and of all positions that are formed using
segments in a grid with \(m\) horizontal and \(n\) vertical lines._

_Solution._ A rectangle is uniquely described by two distinct vertical lines and
two distinct horizontal lines. Therefore we can just select these two lines and 
multiply these quantities by rule of product:

\begin{align*}
  \binom{n}{2}\binom{m}{2}
\end{align*}


# Anagrams {-}

_How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in the word "anagram"?_

_Solution._ We can choose an arrangement of the letters in "anagram" in two
steps. We first choose 3 of the 7 positions to be a's, then permute "ngrm" in
the remaining positions. Thus, we have
\begin{align*}
  \binom{7}{3} 4!
\end{align*}

ways to choose an arrangement.
