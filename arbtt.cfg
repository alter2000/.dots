-- To categorize by calendar periods (months, weeks, or arbitrary periods),
-- I use $date variable, and some auxiliary functions. All these functions
-- evaluate dates in local time. Set TZ environment variable if you need
-- statistics in a different time zone.

-- You can compare dates:
$date >= 2001-01-01 ==> tag this_century,
-- You have to write them in YYYY-MM-DD format, else they will not be recognized.

-- “format $date” produces a string with the date in ISO 8601 format
-- (YYYY-MM-DD), it may be compared with strings. For example, to match
-- everything on and after a particular date I can use
format $date =~ /.*-03-19/  ==> tag period:on_a_special_day,
-- but note that this is a rather expensive operation and will slow down your
-- data processing considerably.

-- “day of month $date” gives the day of month (1..31),
-- “day of week $date” gives a sequence number of the day of week
-- (1..7, Monday is 1):
(day of month $date == 13) && (day of week $date == 5) ==> tag day:friday_13,

month $date == 1 ==> tag month:January,
month $date == 2 ==> tag month:February,
year $date == 2010 ==> tag year:2010,
