# Hello there

<sup>General Kenobi</sup>

Here's my dotfiles. If you want anything specific, just copy ahead. I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), so if you want to use it as-is, typey type this:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alter2000/.dots.git
cd .dots/
./install
```

Note that this will also install everything I usually need (thanks to
[dotbot-pacaur](https://github.com/ajlende/dotbot-pacaur)).
No pictures or keybinding tables here since it's evolving until I settle in my own hardware and workflow.
